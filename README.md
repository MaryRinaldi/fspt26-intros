# fspt26-intros

## What

[A repo](https://github.com/niamh-d/fspt26-intros) in which to share your markdown profile. Contribution is optional. Your profile will be visible to anyone who visits the repo.

## How

### The easy way üòÖ

- Read the instructions in **Step 2**
- Send Niamh your files (profile and images folder) on Slack and she will commit them to the repo. Done! üôå
- Then skip to **Step 5**.

### No, I want a challenge üòé

Please follow the below steps.

#### Step 1 ‚Äì Fork repository and clone to your machine

- Fork your own copy of the repo
- Clone to your own machine
- Get to work

‚ÑπÔ∏è See official GitHub documentation on [forking and cloning a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

#### Step 2 ‚Äì Add Files in main branch

Work within branch **main**. There is no need to create your own branch. This is so we keep all profiles in the same branch for easier visibility and access. None of us share a name, so we can use our name as the title for both our profile and our images folder, as follows:

- Add .md file with title in format "[your-name]" and complete with your intro.

```
  sophie.md
```

- Add folder with title "[your-name]" to store your images

```
  sophie
```

- Make sure that your image paths in your markdown file point to the images **within this folder.**

```
  ![Kitty picture](/sophie/kitty.png)
```

#### Step 3 ‚Äì Commit your files

- As per normal, commit your files. Put your name in the message.

```
git commit -m "sophie"
```

#### Step 4 ‚Äì Make a pull request

- Create a pull request into fspt26-intro repo to have your files integrated into the original repo.
