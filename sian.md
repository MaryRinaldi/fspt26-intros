# About me: Sian Fairley 

Hi! I'm Sian, pronounced "Sharn". It's the female equivalent of Sean/Shaun and pronounced exactly the same way, if you're American or Canadian! Unfortunately it's also the acronym of a far right group here in Norway, where I live. Which is ironic, being an immigrant in the country...

I'm originally from the UK, but before moving to Trondheim in 2021 I had been living in Istanbul, Turkey. I don't quite know how I got there, but I left after 13 years with a husband and two children.

My background is in languages and education. I've loved learning languages for as long as I can remember. I also love learning about absolutely anything and everything, which makes for very interesting Youtube recommendations. Anyway, although it was never my plan, I somehow got drawn back into education and worked as an English teacher for many years. 

## Coding: I started, then stopped...

The possibilties for endless learning online is what originally inspired me to look into coding, as I was interested to learn about the process behind creating ed-tech software. I started exploring Python and NLP Work, as well as html and css. The first time I tried NLP was like actual magic. I took some courses, built some basic projects but was left feeling demotivated when a couple of online initiatives I was involved in aimed at women in tech just disappeared into the ether. Eventually, family and the pandemic got in the way of my coding journey.

### ...but I'm back!

After I moved to Norway I left teaching, but continued to work in education, writing coursebooks and working in digital education as a learning designer. Working remotely has meant I now have the "time" (in the very loosest sense of the word) to push forward with my coding properly this time around. I'm under no illusions that this will be challenging, but I'm excited to start!

#### Barcelona!

I've been to Barcelona a couple of times, the last being a week before the pandemic hit. There are so many aspects to the city that I love, but especially the **food**. I still dream about a white sangria and a dish of roasted eggplant in sauce I enjoyed. If anyone knows what that eggplant dish was and can help find a recipe, I promise to cook it for them one day. 

## Fun-ish facts about me

- Life in Norway is so expensive that I have learned to make everything from scratch. Including our furniture. Thanks to [this group of amazing women](https://www.instagram.com/buildherworkshop/?hl=en) 
- It's very dark here for half of the year, which is ideal for someone whose hobbies are generally indoor based (knitting, sewing, baking etc.)
- The other half of the year, when it's mostly light, I enjoy being outdoors with my family and learning about the nature here. Was disappointed to learn that those pretty red mushrooms with white spots are actually lethal.
